    <h1>3. Purpose, goals and audience</h1>
    <p>The purpose of the website is to provide freshmen at NTNU a guide to Trondheim. The goal is to make students more knowledgeable about the different places in Trondheim and inform students about Sit´s different offerings, such as housing and training facilities.<br><br>
    Our primary audience is the incoming freshmen at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. These students are embarking on an exciting new chapter in their lives, often away from their hometowns and familiar surroundings.They may come from various backgrounds and have diverse interests, so our goal is to provide them with a comprehensive guide that caters to their needs. We aim to make them more knowledgeable about the different facets of Trondheim, including shopping, clubs , walks and services provided by SIT.
